//14. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList: string[] = ["huda", "laraib", "sadaf"];

console.log(`Dear ${guestList[0]}, you are invited to dinner.`);
console.log(`Dear ${guestList[1]}, you are invited to dinner.`);
console.log(`Dear ${guestList[2]}, you are invited to dinner.`);
