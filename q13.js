//13. Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var transportation = ["Honda motor cycle", "civic", "jaguar", "hunda brv"];
console.log("I would like to own a", transportation[0]);
console.log("I would like to own a", transportation[1]);
console.log("I would like to own a", transportation[2]);
console.log("I would like to own a", transportation[3]);
