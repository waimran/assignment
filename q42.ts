//42.  Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    magicians.forEach(magician => {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    return magicians.map(magician => `the Great ${magician}`);
}

let magician: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette", "Teller"];

magicians = make_great(magicians);

show_magicians(magicians);
